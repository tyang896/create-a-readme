# Create A Readme

## Description

This program is a readme generator for your applications. The purpose of creating this app is to allow creators to easily generate a README file while focusing more time on their projects. In the future, I would like to add more responses for users so that you can have a more personalized readme file. 

## Installation

1. To install this application, navigate to your desired installation folder and copy the following code in to your terminal:
```
git clone git@github.com:tyang896/create-a-readme.git
```
2. In VS Code, open the repo in the integrated terminal and install the necessary application dependencies using the following command:
```
npm i
```

## Usage

1. To start the application, open the repo in VS Code's integrated terminal and run the following command:
```
node index.js
```
2. User's will have a series of questions asked about their README.md file. Once all the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be generated in the `Program` folder.


For an example of running the program, refer to the video demonstration [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bmWUIlOCeVO5LpKS_c-3e0xa3dPWm2Dq/view)
